# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Comprehensive Guide to Embodied AI Systems**. This book provides a deep dive into the integration of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems, focusing on humanoid platforms and embodied AI applications.

## About This Book

This comprehensive guide is structured into five modules that build upon each other to create a complete understanding of physical AI systems:

- **Module 1**: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System
- **Module 2**: Digital Twins – Gazebo & Unity
- **Module 3**: AI Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac
- **Module 4**: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)
- **Module 5**: Autonomous Humanoid System

Each module contains multiple chapters that progress from foundational concepts to advanced implementations, ensuring a thorough understanding of how to create embodied AI systems that interact with the physical world through robotic platforms.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this book, you should have:

- Intermediate programming skills in Python
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to RTX-class GPUs or NVIDIA Jetson platforms
- Willingness to work with simulation environments

The content follows strict technical guidelines focusing on implementation with specific code examples, hardware specifications, and simulation parameters rather than abstract concepts.

## Start Learning

Begin with **Module 1** to establish the foundational ROS 2 communication infrastructure for robotic systems, then progress through each module sequentially to build your knowledge of physical AI systems.
